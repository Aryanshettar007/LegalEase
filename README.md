# LegalEase 🚀

Your AI-powered legal assistant for simplifying legal jargon and understanding your rights.

Empowering individuals with accessible legal knowledge.

## About

LegalEase is an AI-powered application designed to simplify legal information and make it accessible to everyone. It aims to bridge the gap between complex legal jargon and the average person's understanding, empowering individuals to better understand their rights and navigate legal processes.

The application uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze legal documents, answer legal questions, and provide summaries of complex legal concepts. It is targeted towards individuals who need quick and easy access to legal information, such as students, small business owners, and anyone facing legal challenges.

LegalEase is built using JavaScript, leveraging Node.js for the backend and a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React - not explicitly defined in the repo, but assumed) for the frontend. The architecture includes an API layer for communication between the frontend and backend, and utilizes external NLP libraries for processing legal text. The unique selling point is its ability to provide personalized and easy-to-understand legal information using AI.
